# SWUTSCH

In the summer semester of 2016, the media group project [SWUTSCH](https://www.hs-augsburg.de/Gestaltung/Projekte/Swutsch.html) started, which means "pub crawl" in Hamburg. The project is about music visualization for the club [HALLO WERNER](https://www.hallowerner.net/) in Augsburg.

Hallo Werner is a popular club in the heart of Augsburg, known for its Hamburg-like atmosphere. Based on the identity and the structural conditions of the Hallo Wermer, an individual concept was developed: A screen with about 2000 pixels, which serves as a physical filter for any video material for visuals in the club. In combination with a fog machine in the room and the distorted bright images, atmospheric effects and a new world are created.
